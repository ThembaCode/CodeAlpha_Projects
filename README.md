# CodeAlpha_Projects
This is my very first repository containing 3 different scripts of code that I created during my internship with CodeAlpha. 
1. Chatbot: The first code is the Chatbot, which is a chatbot code that answers basic questions.
2. TaskAutomation: The second code is a task Automation File. Which automatically organizes files in a download folder.
3. Hangman: The third code is a hangman game, which allows users to guess a random predefined word and gives them a couple of chances to get the right answer
